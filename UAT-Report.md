# AmpGI User Acceptance Testing Report

## Executive Summary

**Testing Date:** January 30, 2025  
**Tested Version:** 0.1.0  
**Testing Status:** üü° PARTIALLY PASSING - Major functionality gaps identified

AmpGI shows a solid foundation with working CLI structure and basic profile management, but falls significantly short of the ambitious vision outlined in AmpGI-Plan.md. The implementation is more of a basic MCP server installer rather than the comprehensive "general intelligence extension" described in the plan.

## üü¢ Working Features

### ‚úÖ Core CLI Structure
- **Command Interface**: All planned CLI commands exist (`install`, `list`, `test`, `apply`)
- **Profile System**: 4 profiles implemented (Personal, Developer, Researcher, Thinker)
- **Dry Run Mode**: Installation preview works correctly
- **Error Handling**: Basic error messages with colored output
- **Help System**: Command help and usage information functional

### ‚úÖ MCP Server Registry
- **Server Definitions**: 8 MCP servers configured in registry
- **Profile Mapping**: Servers properly mapped to profiles
- **Configuration Generation**: Valid Amp configuration output
- **Testing Framework**: Unit tests pass for registry functionality

### ‚úÖ Basic User Experience
- **Detection**: VS Code Amp installation detection works
- **Installation Planning**: Shows what will be installed before proceeding
- **Status Reporting**: Clear feedback on installation steps

## üî¥ Critical Gaps vs. Plan Requirements

### ‚ùå Phase 1: MCP Server Integration (MAJOR GAPS)

**Plan Required:**
- Gmail, Google Calendar, Slack, Microsoft Teams integration
- Database operations (ClickHouse, SQL servers)
- Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, Box)
- Git operations, Web scraping, API integration

**Current State:**
- Only 8 basic servers defined (mostly test/development focused)
- Missing ALL major communication and productivity servers
- No actual integration with mcpservers.org ecosystem
- No real-world business capability servers

### ‚ùå Installation Experience (BROKEN)

**Plan Required:**
- Smooth onboarding with guided setup
- Authentication flows for OAuth services
- Credential management and security

**Current Issues:**
- Installation process crashes with readline error
- No authentication setup whatsoever
- No credential management system
- No actual MCP server installation (just config generation)

### ‚ùå Security & Safety (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

**Plan Required:**
- Sandboxed execution with process isolation
- Permission tiers (Low/Medium/High privilege)
- OS keychain integration for credentials
- Safe mode for new users

**Current State:**
- No sandboxing or security controls
- Basic permission labeling only (not enforced)
- No credential storage system
- No safety mechanisms

### ‚ùå Advanced Features (MISSING)

**Plan Required:**
- Multi-server orchestration and workflow automation
- Shared context store for cross-server operations
- Resource governance and monitoring
- Community registry with compatibility testing

**Current State:**
- Static server registry only
- No orchestration capabilities
- No resource management
- No community features

## üü° Implementation Quality Assessment

### Code Structure: 6/10
- Clean modular architecture
- Good separation of concerns
- ES modules usage follows best practices
- Missing comprehensive error handling

### User Experience: 4/10
- Good CLI design principles
- Clear command structure
- Installation process completely broken
- Missing guided onboarding

### Documentation: 7/10
- Excellent README with step-by-step instructions
- Good command reference
- Comprehensive plan document
- Missing technical implementation docs

### Testing: 5/10
- Unit tests for registry functionality
- No integration tests
- No end-to-end testing
- No error case coverage

## üìä Plan Completion Status

| Feature Category | Plan Requirement | Implementation Status | Gap Level |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Core CLI | Complete CLI interface | ‚úÖ Implemented | None |
| MCP Registry | Static server catalog | ‚úÖ Basic version | Low |
| Profile System | Pre-built configurations | ‚úÖ 4 profiles | Low |
| Installation | One-click setup | ‚ùå Broken | Critical |
| Server Ecosystem | 20+ production servers | ‚ùå 8 test servers | Critical |
| Authentication | OAuth flows | ‚ùå Not started | Critical |
| Security | Sandboxing & permissions | ‚ùå Not implemented | Critical |
| Orchestration | Multi-server workflows | ‚ùå Not started | High |
| Community | Dynamic registry | ‚ùå Not started | Medium |

## üéØ Readiness Assessment

### For Development Use: 30%
- Basic structure exists but key functionality broken
- Suitable for proof-of-concept development only

### For Production Use: 10%
- Missing critical security and authentication features
- Installation process completely non-functional
- No real-world server integrations

### For End Users: 5%
- Installation fails immediately
- No value delivery for intended use cases
- Would likely frustrate rather than help users

## üö® Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

1. **Installation Process Failure** - Core functionality completely broken
2. **Missing Server Ecosystem** - No integration with actual MCP servers
3. **Zero Authentication** - Cannot connect to any real services
4. **No Security Model** - Unsafe for any production use
5. **Gap vs. Marketing** - Reality far from promised capabilities

## üìà Recommendations

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. Fix the installation readline crash
2. Implement actual MCP server package installation
3. Add at least 2-3 working real-world servers (filesystem, fetch)

### Short Term (Month 1)
1. Implement basic authentication flows
2. Add security sandboxing for high-privilege servers
3. Integrate with official MCP server ecosystem

### Long Term (Months 2-3)
1. Build the orchestration and workflow features
2. Implement community registry capabilities
3. Add monitoring and resource management

The current implementation is a solid foundation but needs significant development to meet the ambitious goals set out in the plan.
